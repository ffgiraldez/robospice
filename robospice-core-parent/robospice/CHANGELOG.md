Release 1.4.1 (planned)

* More testing.
* a new method to execute request is now possible : getFromCacheButLoadFromNetworkAnyway. It allows to get data from cache if it is not expired but will always perform the request anyway.
* issue 36 solved : ProgressUpdates where not receive in the right order. Thx to Alessio Bianchi
